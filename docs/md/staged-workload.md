# Staged Workloads

A staged workload is a discrete body of work, which takes data from a source,
pushes it into a workflow executor for analysis,
and then delivers the results of the analysis to an output location (also known as a sink).

## Staged Workload Components
### Source
The workload [Source](./source.md) models the first stage of a processing pipeline.
In a typical workload configuration, a `Source` can be used to read workflow inputs
from a specified location or service in the cloud.

### Executor
The workload [Executor](./executor.md) models an intermediate stage of a processing pipeline.
In a typical workload configuration, an `Executor` uses a supported
service in the cloud to execute workflows.

### Sink
The workload [Sink](./sink.md) models the terminal stage of a processing pipeline.
In a typical workload configuration, a `Sink` can be used to write workflow outputs
to a desired location in the cloud.

## Example Staged Workload
The specific values below are from the
[COVID-19 Surveillance in Terra](./modules-covid.md) project.
Workloads for other projects may leverage different implementations for source, executor or sink.

!!! tip "`watchers` of a workload"
    You may have noticed the optional `watchers` field in the requests.
    As of `2021/08` WFL supports registering Slack channels
    (Slack channel IDs that starts with a `C`)
    as watchers of the workload.
    Your channel needs to live in the `broadinstitute.slack.com` Slack organization
    and you also have to `/invite @WorkFlow Launcher Notifier`
    to invite the WFL notifier to your channel
    before the channel can receive user facing messaged from WFL.
