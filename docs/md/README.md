# Welcome to WorkFlow Launcher

## Overview

[WorkFlow Launcher (WFL)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wfl.git)
is a workload manager.

It runs as you, with your credentials, from your laptop, and
communicates with other services as necessary to manage a workload.

It can also be deployed to run as a service in the cloud.

For more on Workflow Launcher's role in the Terra infrastructure see
[Workflow Launcher's role in Terra (./docs/md/terra.md)](./terra.md).

## Set up

Run `boot build` at the top of a `wfl.git` repo to build an
uberjar. The resulting jar is in `./target/wfl-*.jar` relative to
the `wfl.git` clone.

With some start-up and performance penalty, you can also run
Workflow Launcher as a script. See below for details.

## Versioning

Workflow Launcher needs to manage its version and the versions of
`dsde-pipelines.git` which contribute the WDL files. There may be as
many `dsde-pipelines.git` versions as there are workflow wdls.

The `wfl` jar includes a manifest with at least that information in
it, and a version command that returns it.

## Capabilities

When Workflow Launcher is on-premises or in the cloud, it can
currently talk to the following services:

| service                     | on premises | in cloud |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Cloud SQL                   | x           | x        |
| Cromwell                    | x           | x        |
| Google App Engine           | x           | x        |
| Google Cloud Platform Admin | x           | x        |
| Google Cloud Pub/Sub        | x           | x        |
| Google Cloud Storage        | x           | x        |
| Oracle DB                   | x           |          |
| Vault                       | x           | x        |
| Wfl                         |             | x        |

Workflow Launcher has a diagnostic mode, `dx`,
for debugging problems.

Run `zero dx` to get a list of the diagnostics available.

```bash
wm28d-f87:wfl yanc$ java -jar ./target/wfl-2020-03-13t17-29-12z.jar dx

zero dx: tools to help debug workflow problems.

Usage: zero dx <tool> [<arg> ...]
Where: <tool> is the name of some diagnostic tool.
       <arg> ... are optional arguments to <tool>.

The <tool>s and their <arg>s are named here.
  all-metadata environment & ids
    All workflow metadata for IDS from Cromwell in ENVIRONMENT.
  event-timing environment id
    Time per event type for workflow with ID in ENVIRONMENT.
...
Error: Must specify a dx <tool> to run.
BTW: You ran: zero dx
wm28d-f87:wfl yanc$
```

#### Top-level files

After cloning a new WFL repo, the top-level files are.

  - `./README.md` is this file, which is just a symlink to the actual doc
    file under `docs/md/`.

  - `./boot.properties` overrides some defaults in `boot-clj`.
    (`boot.properties` is something like `build.properties` for
    `sbt`.)

  - `./build.boot` is a Clojure script to bootstrap WFL with
    `boot-clj`.

  - `./build.txt` holds a monotonically increasing integer for
    build versioning.

  - `./.github` holds Github related files, such as PR templates and
    Github Actions files.

  - `./database` holds database scheme migration changelog and changeset
    files for liquibase.

  - `./docs` has ancillary documentation. It's compiled as a static doc
    website.

  - `./ops` is a directory of standard scripts to support
    operations. It includes scripts to deploy the server in
    Google App Engine, and to run it locally for easier
    debugging. (See [./docs/md/server.md](./server.md) for
    more information.)

  - `./resources` contains the `simplelogger` properties and
    files staged from other repositories that need to be on the
    Java classpath when running from the `.jar` file.

  - `./src/zero` contains the Workflow Launcher source code.

  - `./test/zero` contains some unit tests.

After building and working with WFL a while, you may notice a
couple of other top-level files and directories.

  - `./project.clj` is a `lein` project file to support
    IntelliJ.

  - `./zero` is a link to `build.boot` that runs WFL as a
    script.

Run `boot build` at least once after cloning the repo to make
sure all the necessary files are in place.

#### Source code

The Clojure source code is in the `./src/zero` directory.

The entry point for the WFL executable is the `-main` function
in `main.clj`. It takes the command line arguments as strings,
validates the arguments, then launches the appropriate process.

The `server.clj` file implements the WFL server. The
`server_debug.clj` file adds some tools to aid in debugging the
server.

Some hacks specific to WFL are in `zero.clj`.

The `boot.clj` offloads code from the `build.boot` file for
easier development and debugging.

The `debug.clj` file defines some macros useful when debugging
or logging.

The `util.clj` file contains a few function and macros used in
WFL that are not specific to its function.

The `environments.clj` file defines configuration parameters for
different execution contexts. It's a placeholder in this repo
but will be loaded in build/deploy time from a private repo.

The `module/ukb.clj` file implements a command-line starter for the
**White Album**, **Pharma5**, or **UK Biobank** project.

The `module/xx.clj` file implements a command-line starter for
reprocessing *eXternal eXomes*.

The `module/wgs.clj` file helps implements a command-line starter for
reprocessing *Whole GenomeS*.

The `module/all.clj` file hosts some utilities shared across modules.

The `metadata.clj` file implements a tool to extract metadata
from Cromwell that can be archived with the outputs generated by
a workflow.

The `dx.clj` file implements miscellaneous pipeline debugging
tools.

The `once.clj` file defines some initialization functions mostly
supporting authentication.

The `api/handlers.clj` file defines the handler functions used by
server.

The `api/routes.clj` file defines the routing strategy for server.

Each of the other source files implement an interface to one of
the services WFL talks to, and are named accordingly.

| File         | Service                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| cromwell.clj | Cromwell workflow runner                  |
| datarepo.clj | DSP DataRepo                              |
| db.clj       | On-prem and Cloud SQL databases           |
| gcs.clj      | Google Cloud Storage                      |
| jms.clj      | Java Message Service queues               |
| postgres.clj | Cloud SQL postgres databases              |
| pubsub.clj   | Google Cloud Pub/Sub                      |
| server.clj   | the WFL server itself                     |
| wdl.clj      | parse WDL and manage dependencies         |

#### Test code

There are some unit tests under `./test/zero/`.

| File                      | Test the namespace        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| gcs<sub>test</sub>.clj    | zero.gcs in gcs.clj       |
| pubsub<sub>test</sub>.clj | zero.pubsub in pubsub.clj |

#### Development

WFL is implemented in [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and uses a
tool named `boot` or `boot-clj` to manage dependencies and so on.
The `boot` tool is a Clojure bootstrapper: it's job is to turn a
standard Linux, MacOS, or Windows process into something that can
host a Clojure program.

WFL uses a `gcloud auth` command line to authenticate the user. You
need to be authenticated to Google Cloud and have a recent version
of `google-cloud-sdk` in your path to run `zero` or its jar
successfully. I verified that `Google Cloud SDK 161.0.0` works. That
or any later version should be OK.

1.  Installation

    See [this link](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install) to
    install `boot-clj`.

    Running `boot` is enough to "install" Clojure.

    There is another tool like `boot` named `lein`, which is short
    for "[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)". You currently need
    `lein` to develop with
    [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) using its Clojure
    plugin [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/).

    On MacOS, I suggest installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and
    then running this.

    ``` bash
    wfl # brew install boot-clj leiningen
    ==> Using the sandbox
    ==> Downloading https://github.com/boot-clj/boot-bin/releases/download/2.5.2/boot
    🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/boot-clj/2.5.2: 3 files, 7.7K, built in 2 seconds
    ...
    wfl #
    ```

    You can `brew install maven`, and `java` too if necessary.

    There are `boot-clj` and `lein` distributions for all the common
    OS platforms. Each tool is just a file. Copy them into your
    `PATH`, run them once to bootstrap them, and you're done. (The
    first run of each tool downloads dependencies and so on.)

    The `build.boot` file is equivalent to the `build.sbt` file for
    SBT in Scala projects. It specified project dependencies and the
    build and release pipeline. It also functions as a script for
    running and testing the project without a separate compilation
    step.

2.  Hacking

    Clojure development feels very different from Scala and Java
    development. It even differs markedly from development in other
    *dynamic languages* such as Python or Ruby.

    Get a demonstration from someone familiar with Clojure
    development before you spend too much time trying to figure
    things out on your own.

    Find a local Cursive user for guidance if you like IntelliJ.
    [Rex Wang](mailto:chengche@broadinstitute.org) and [Saman Ehsan](mailto:sehsan@broadinstitute.org) know how to use it. There
    are [Cursive licenses
    here](https://broadinstitute.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDE/pages/48234557/Software%2BLicenses%2B-%2BCursive).
    There is also a
    [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva)
    plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

    I hack Clojure in Emacs using
    [CIDER](https://cider.readthedocs.io/) and
    [nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl). CIDER is not
    trivial to set up, but not *especially* difficult if you are
    used to Emacs. (I can help if CIDER gives you trouble.)

    Every time `boot` runs, it generates a `project.clj` file to
    support `lein`, Cursive, and Calva users.

    Running `boot build` will not only build a fat jar (*uberjar*)
    for the WFL project, but will add an executable symbolic link
    `zero` to conveniently execute the Clojure code as a script.

3.  Testing

    If you've never run `boot` before, you may have to run it twice:
    first to bootstrap Clojure and `boot` itself, and again to
    download their and WFL's dependencies.

    The first `boot build` run will create a `./zero` link to the
    `build.boot` file

    ```bash
    ./zero starter dev $USER@broadinstitute.org
    ```

    You should eventually receive an humongous email from
    `zero@broadinstitute.org` containing evidence of Zero's
    adventures.

    The result should look something like this.

    ```bash
